            <span id="keyword">CSS</span> (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages â€” for example, to alter the font, color, size, and
            spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module
            provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks
            like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.

                <li>A basic work environment set up, as detailed in <a href="#" class="simple-link">Installing basic software</a>, and an understanding of how to create and
